MemoryScope is a powerful and flexible long term memory system for LLM chatbots. It consists
of a memory database and three customizable system operations, which can be flexibly combined to provide
robust long term memory services for your LLM chatbot.

üíæ Memory Database:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MemoryScope comes with an *ElasticSearch (ES)* vector database to store all the
memory pieces recorded in the system.

üõ†Ô∏è System operations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Memory Retrieval: Upon arrival of a user query, this operation returns the semantically related memory pieces
and/or those from the corresponding time if the query involves reference to time.

- Memory Consolidation: This operation takes in a batch of user queries and returns important user information
extracted from the queries as consolidated *observations* to be stored in the memory database.

- Reflection and Re-consolidation: At regular intervals, this operation performs reflection upon newly recorded *observations*
to form and update *insights*. Then, memory re-consolidation is performed to ensure contradictions and repetitions
among memory pieces are properly handled.
